### CPSC 120

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was a favorite because I was able to calculate the average
    of a set of scores after removing the minimum and maximum scores. The code 
    demonstrates effective use of vectors, loops, and conditional statements.
    I learned more about handling command line arguments, parsing data, and 
    implementing basic error checking.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, my favorite part is its modular design. It shows how to read data
    from a CSV file using std::ifstream. It taught me how to open a file, read
    its contents, and handle file-related operations. I also learned more about
    in file handling, data parsing, and object-oriented programming, providing
    a solid foundation for future projects.

* Lab 12
    
    Lab 12, I appreciate the dynamic image generation in this program using
    Magick++. It taught me how to work with external libraries for graphics,
    create images with specific properties, and understand the process of image
    manipulation. Overall, it was a fun and challenging lab.
